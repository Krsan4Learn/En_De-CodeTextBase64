# En_De-CodeTextBase64
Simple code in Python to understand how to encode texts and decrypt texts with base64

I created this simple script in order to teach beginners how to use base64 to encode and decode texts in general with support for many human languages, so you can encode and decode by writing English text, Arabic text, Spanish text, Chinese text, or wherever it is.
